# QuestionableReportingPractices

In this project, we aim to provide a thorough overview of the state of changes to prespecified outcomes, 
from the first trial registration to the results publication, 
and spin related to primary outcomes in results publications.

We assess publicly available registry information (ClinicalTrials.gov, DRKS), 
including historical records, of a sample of clinical trials conducted in Germany between 2009 and 2017. 
Specifically, we determine the extent to which trials show changes of outcomes in the registry entry 
(within-registration changes), and between the last registry entry before publication and the respective publication. 
We assess how changes to the outcome are reported in the respective publication. 
Additionally, we look at spin in the reporting of statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes.
