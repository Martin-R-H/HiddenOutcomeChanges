If BP measurements varied by 10 mmHg, an additional measurement was performed. The accumulated measurements were then averaged to determine overall SBP and DBP.

To assess PBI, gingival sulcus was spread out using a periodontal probe (PCP 15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA); the PBI score ranges from score 0 (no bleeding) to score 4 (profuse bleeding). Furthermore, the GI was used to assess changes of the gingiva. A score from 0 (normal gingiva, inflammation-free, no discoloration, no bleeding) to score 3 (severe inflammation, reddening and swelling, tendency toward spontaneous bleeding or ulceration) was used.\nAfter assessment of gingival inflammation, plaque extension was evaluated using the Plaque Index by Quigley and Hein (QHI) modified by Turesky et al. after using a plaque-disclosing agent (Mira-2-Ton®, Hager & Werken GmbH & Co. KG, Duisburg, Germany) [23, 24]. Plaque accumulation on the smooth surfaces of the tooth (buccal, oral) was assessed and evaluated on a scale with six grades (score 0 = no plaque; score 5 = plaque extending to the coronal third). Furthermore, the Marginal Plaque Index (MPI) by Deinzer et al. was used to differentiate plaque extension at the gingival margin [25]. The evaluation was performed on eight measuring points at each tooth (score 0 = no plaque; score 1 = plaque).&quot;	ss_calculation	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	NULL	NULL		some_significant	Plaque indices (mod.

With OR, I and NI subgroups showed a statistically significant reduction of MPI (I: p = 0.04, NI: p &lt; 0.01) and of mod. QHI (p &lt; 0.01).

Comparing the outcome of all subgroups at t3, no statistically significant differences could be found between any of the subgroups for MPI (p = 0.34) and mod. QHI (p = 0.08; Table 2).\n\nGingival inflammation indices (PBI, GI; Table 3)\nWithin the MTB group, no statistically significant changes in PBI were found between t0 and t3 for both I (p = 0.14) and NI (p = 0.15). Regarding GI, a significant improvement could be found in the I subgroup of MTB (p = 0.03). In the OR group, no significant reduction of PBI and GI was detected (p i &gt; 0.05). Within the SA group, the I subgroup showed a statistically significant reduction in PBI (p = 0.02), and, for the NI subgroup, a significant improvement of GI was found (p = 0.05; Table 3).

The original primary outcome measure was the composite of death from any cause, reinfarction, or non-CABG major bleeding, which became the principal secondary outcome after the change in the protocol. The change in the primary outcome was made in order to reduce the necessary sample size and occurred while the investigators were still unaware of study outcomes. Details of the circumstances surrounding the change in the primary outcome are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nAppendix: The original primary outcome of EUROMAX was a composite of death, reinfarction, or non–coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)-related major bleeding measured at 30 days, and required 3680 patients, assuming a composite event rate of 6.5% for bivalirudin and 9.0% for heparins with optional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (absolute risk reduction of 2.5%, relative risk reduction of 28%).\nEnrollment in EUROMAX started in March 2010. Over the year 2011, enrollment was slower than anticipated, due to the logistic constraints of conducting a multinational, randomized ambulance ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) trial and to competing prehospital STEMI trials across Europe. In February 2012, almost 2 years after starting enrollment, the number of patients enrolled in the trial was only 972. In February 2012, while still entirely blinded to trial results, and before any interim analysis was performed, the executive committee changed the 30-day primary outcome to the composite of death or major bleeding, keeping the triple composite of death, reinfarction, and major bleeding as a principal secondary outcome. This decision was made based on slow enrollment. Given the anticipated null effect of study treatments on reinfarction, as observed in the HORIZONS-AMI trial,1 removal of reinfarction from the primary outcome increased the expected relative risk reduction. With the removal of the reinfarction component from the primary endpoint and a slight increase in the expected treatment effect, the sample size was reduced to 2200 subjects while maintaining 80% power. The new assumptions were that the composite event rate of death and non– CABG-related major bleeding would be 4.25% for bivalirudin and 7.0% for the heparins with optional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (absolute risk reduction of 2.75%, relative risk reduction of 39%).	switch_during_active	all_significant	Bivalirudin, as compared with the control intervention, reduced the risk of the primary outcome (5.1% vs. 8.5%; relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.82; P=0.001).

After 30 min resting in supine position, blood gases were sampled from the arterialized ear lobe. Then, each patient received oxygen via nasal cannula from one of the POCs. The oxygen delivery rate was chosen according to the results of the technical test to obtain approximately comparable delivery rates of 2.0e2.5 l O2/min. The devices were then changed in a random order. We obtained blood gas results and oxygen saturation data from each patient after a steady state period of 30 min with each device.
