Significant would include laboratory deviations requiring acute medical intervention or further medical evaluation.\nPatients must have a negative urinary drug screen at Visit 1.\nPatients must have no medical history of heart disease that could be destabilized by increases in heart rate or blood pressure. The screening electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Visit 1 must not show significant abnormalities. Significant would include a heart rate of less than 40 bpm and more than 120 bpm respectively, any disturbances in rhythm and conduction as well as ECG-findings pointing to myocardial infarction.\nFemales of childbearing potential defined as women not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year post-menopause must test negative for pregnancy at Visit 1 based on an urinary pregnancy test and agree to use a reliable method of birth control (e.g., oral contraceptives, a reliable barrier method of birth control like diaphragms, intrauterine devices; partner with vasectomy or abstinence) during the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe exclusion criteria are designed to eliminate patients who do not meet study population criteria or whose participation in the study would be inappropriate due to underlying safety issues and to ensure that patients participating in the study are in a stable physical condition.

Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.\nPatients who meet full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for any history of bipolar or psychotic disorder, current major depression, current generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder will be excluded from the study. Assessment will be done by clinical history and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders (SCID).\nPatients who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any prescribed or over-the-counter medication in a manner which the investigator considers indicative of abuse or who meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse, assessed by clinical history and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Patients must not use drugs of abuse or illicitly obtained prescription drugs during the study, and a urine drug screen may be obtained at any time during the study. Alcohol use should be discouraged, and if, in the investigator's judgment, the patient is using alcohol to excess, the patient should be discontinued.\nPatients, who in the opinion of the investigator, are at serious suicidal or homicidal risk.\nPatients with organic brain disease, for example, dementia, traumatic brain injury residual, or a history of any seizure disorder (except febrile seizures during childhood).\nPatients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications or multiple adverse drug reactions.\nPatients who have a known history of narrow angle glaucoma.\nMales with prostatic symptoms.\nPatients with significant medical conditions that are likely to become unstable during the trial or would likely be destabilized by treatment with atomoxetine, (for example, cardiovascular disease that would be at aggravated by increased heart-rate), or require treatment with excluded medications.\nPatients who have any medical condition or who are taking a medication on a daily basis (for example albuterol, inhalation aerosols) that has sympathomimetic activity.\nPatients with hypertension.

Significant would include laboratory deviations requiring acute medical intervention or further medical evaluation.\nPatients must have a negative urinary drug screen at Visit 1.\nPatients must have no medical history of heart disease that could be destabilized by increases in heart rate or blood pressure. The screening electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Visit 1 must not show significant abnormalities. Significant would include a heart rate of less than 40 bpm and more than 120 bpm respectively, any disturbances in rhythm and conduction as well as ECG-findings pointing to myocardial infarction.\nFemales of childbearing potential defined as women not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year post-menopause must test negative for pregnancy at Visit 1 based on an urinary pregnancy test and agree to use a reliable method of birth control (e.g., oral contraceptives, a reliable barrier method of birth control like diaphragms, intrauterine devices; partner with vasectomy or abstinence) during the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe exclusion criteria are designed to eliminate patients who do not meet study population criteria or whose participation in the study would be inappropriate due to underlying safety issues and to ensure that patients participating in the study are in a stable physical condition. They further are designed to maintain consistency with the approved global labeling for atomoxetine.\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\nPatients who are investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or are immediate family of investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.\nPatients who meet full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for any history of bipolar or psychotic disorder, current major depression, current generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder will be excluded from the study. Assessment will be done by clinical history and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders (SCID).\nPatients who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any prescribed or over-the-counter medication in a manner which the investigator considers indicative of abuse or who meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse, assessed by clinical history and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Patients must not use drugs of abuse or illicitly obtained prescription drugs during the study, and a urine drug screen may be obtained at any time during the study. Alcohol use should be discouraged, and if, in the investigator's judgment, the patient is using alcohol to excess, the patient should be discontinued.\nPatients, who in the opinion of the investigator, are at serious suicidal or homicidal risk.\nPatients with organic brain disease, for example, dementia, traumatic brain injury residual, or a history of any seizure disorder (except febrile seizures during childhood).\nPatients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications or multiple adverse drug reactions.\nPatients who have a known history of narrow angle glaucoma.\nMales with prostatic symptoms.\nPatients with significant medical conditions that are likely to become unstable during the trial or would likely be destabilized by treatment with atomoxetine, (for example, cardiovascular disease that would be at aggravated by increased heart-rate), or require treatment with excluded medications.\nPatients who have any medical condition or who are taking a medication on a daily basis (for example albuterol, inhalation aerosols) that has sympathomimetic activity.\nPatients with hypertension. For the purposes of this protocol, hypertension will be defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure, measured on at least 2 separate occasions, greater than or equal to 140/90. Patients whose blood pressure is controlled with non-excluded medication are eligible for inclusion.\nPatient taking any psychotropic medications on a daily basis within 2 weeks before Visit1.
