The maximal percent inhibition is the percent inhibition that is achieved in a titration of the drug at high concentrations when the addition of more drug does not result in increased inhibition. Maximal percent inhibition is obtained in the same way as the titration for IC50, but the key measure is of the plateau height of percent inhibition, where increased concentration of maraviroc does not result in additional inhibition.
