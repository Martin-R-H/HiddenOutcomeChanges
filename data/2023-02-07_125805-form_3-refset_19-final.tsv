Before the test session the participants practiced tread- mill walking for about five minutes in order to become familiar with the ST and DT walking task until they felt comfortable. A staircase method was used with going up to a certain level of comfortable walking speed and in- creasing and decreasing from that point until comfort- able pace is achieved afterwards. Gait parameters such as step length (cm), step width (cm), and gait line, which describes the length of the foot rolling movements (cm) were measured as main outcome parameters. Our training regime focused mainly on the gait quality and associated the kinematic parameters. Since there is a controversial discussion about gait variability, for this study we focused on the reported gait parameters, which have been shown to be important walking variables as well [21].\n\nA visual-verbal Stroop test with 30 events of incongru- ent coloured words (e.g. the word “blue” presented in a yellow font) was added to the walking test as a cognitive DT. Stimuli were projected onto a white wall two meters in front of the participants. Participants were asked to name the colour of the font letters word and inhibit reading the word. The time interval between word inser- tions randomly varied between 0.8 and 1.2 ms to avoid rhythm. A randomized process distributed three out of four different versions of the Stroop test to the partici- pants (1. familiarization while sitting, 2. ST standing, 3. DT combined with treadmill walking) were presented to the participants. All tests were recorded as a Stroop video including the verbal responses to the visualised colour word on the screen.

Subjective fear was assessed 5 sec. after onset of the VR height scene, and at five regularly spaced times during the 10 minutes exposure challenge (see Figure 2) via fear ratings ranging from 0 (no fear) to 100 (maximum fear) following the convention introduced by Wolpe (1969).\n(Methods) Psychophysiological measures. Heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) were registered during baseline and throughout the exposure challenge with a V-Amp amplifier (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Five one-minute intervals during the challenge, during which participants did not speak to give fear ratings, were chosen for analysis (see Figure 2). Saliva samples for cortisol measurements were taken at baseline and 7 and 45 minutes after the challenge with Salivette tubes (Sarstedt, Germany). Participants were given an additional sampling kit and instructed to take a home sample at the same time as the experiment on a day of comparable overall stress level. Instructions included detailed information on how to avoid contamination of the saliva sample due to food, drink, or dental hygiene. Participants mailed their samples to the study centre. To account for the possible influence of female sex hormones on cortisol levels (Kudielka, Hellhammer, &amp; Wüst, 2009), women without oral contraception were tested in the luteal phase. Saliva samples were frozen at -20°C and stored until analysis at -°80C.	first_reported	NULL	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	1	NULL		NULL		multiple_primaries	NULL	NULL

The coprimary end points of IELT and PEP were chosen to demonstrate a prolonged time to ejaculation (IELT) and that this prolongation is clinically meaningful (significant improvements in PEP subscores).\n(...)\nIELT is defined as the time from vaginal penetration to ejaculation in the vagina. All previously published phase 3 studies of on-demand oral treatment for PE calculated the arithmetic mean IELT per subject visit and reported differences in either arithmetic mean or geometric mean per treatment group [7,18–21]. Waldinger and colleagues cautioned researchers against calculating arithmetic mean IELT to summarize data of individuals or group results because it could overestimate the treatment effect [22]. We examined median IELT per subject and per treatment group because IELT is highly positively skewed and the median is a nonparametric summary statistic that makes no assumption about the underlying distribution.\nThe PEP is a validated self-report questionnaire used to assess the four measures of PE defined by the DSM-IV-TR [23]: satisfaction with sexual intercourse, control over ejaculation, ejaculation-related distress, and interpersonal difficulty. Each measure regarding ejaculation is scored on a 5-point scale. Criteria for clinical benefit were defined as achieving a twocategory or greater increase in the change in control over ejaculation and a one-category or greater increase in the change in ejaculation-related distress at the study end point compared with baseline values [18–20].\nFemale partners also completed the PEP at each visit; questions related to the woman’s satisfaction with intercourse, ejaculation-related distress, and interpersonal difficulty, as well as her perception of the man’s control over ejaculation.	explicit	NULL	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL		[Left blank]		multiple_primaries	Tramadol ODT resulted in significant increases in median IELT compared with placebo; increases were 0.6 min (1.6 fold), 1.2 min (2.4 fold), and 1.5 min (2.5 fold) for placebo, 62 mg tramadol ODT, and 89 mg tramadol ODT, respectively ( p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

Antibody responses to JEV and PCECV were assessed by neutralization assays; the validated 50% plaque reduction neutralization test for JE antibodies was performed according to existing  methodology [20]. Antibody titers or concentrations were expressed as GMTs or GMCs and percentage of subjects with seroresponse was defined as those with anti-JE neutralizing antibody titers ?1/10 or anti-rabies virus antibody concentrations ?0.5 IU/mL. Antibody responses to MenACWY-CRM were assessed by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). The hSBA antibody responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y were expressed as hSBA GMTs, percentage of subjects with seroresponse (at least a fourfold increase in titers from a pre-vaccination titer ?4 or a rise to ?8 in those with a pre-vaccination titer &lt;4), and percentage of subjects achieving hSBA titers &gt;= 8.	explicit	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	(Methods) Results of concomitant administration of MenACWY-CRM vaccine with typhoid and yellow fever vaccinations are reported in a separate manuscript.\n(Figure 1) Not included in report: Typhiod fever, Yellow fever	unclear	multiple_primaries	[Left blank]	NULL

All scans were performed in supine position with the leg resting in a jig to ensure a constant internal rotation of 15. The BMD (g/cm2) data collected at 1 week after surgery served as the baseline value and changes were expressed in percent. To detect BMD changes around the implant, contralateral hip and lumbar spine served as a benchmark. All scans and analyses were performed by the same observer using the metal-removal hip-scan mode. Due to the different stem lengths the conventional seven regions of interest (ROI), described by Gruen et al. [13], were adapted so that the length of the implant was not divided into six ROIs of equal size. Instead, the proximal ROIs one (medial) and 7 (lateral) had a length of 6 cm, ROIs 2 (medial) and 6 (lateral) had a length of 4 cm, and ROIs 3 (medial) and 5 (lateral) covered the remaining distance.

The serum concentrations of OC, BAP, tartrate-resistant-acidphosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), and urinary concentrations of deoxypyridoniline (DPD) were quantifi ed using the enzymatic immunoassays from MicroVue (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA). Concentration of intact PTH in plasma was measured using an enzymatic immunoassay (Biomerica Inc, Irvine, CA, USA). Serum concentration of sclerostin was measured using the enzymatic immunoassay from TECO (TECO medicals AG, Sissach, Switzerland). The quantification of 25(OH)D at baseline and aft er 12 months of supplementation was carried out using the Immun-Liaison system (DiaSorin Deutschland GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany). The quantification of tHcy and methylmalonic acid (MMA) was performed by a modifi ed GC-MS method according to Stabler et al. [ 37 ]. The quantifi cation of total vitamin B12 was performed using a chemiluminescent immunoassay performed on the ADVIA Centaur XP System platform. The determination of holoTC was performed using a micro particle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria). SAH and SAM were quantifi ed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) [ 38 ]. Serum 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF) was determined using UPLC-MS/MS method [ 39 ]. Creatinine in urine was determined using the Cobas system (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

Primary outcome measures of sternal union, pain, and function were tested for noninferiority and superiority. Patients were evaluated for sternal union using CT, postoperative sternal pain using a visual analog scale [14], and functional outcomes using the Heart Surgery Symptom Index [15]. Evaluators were blinded to the method of sternal closure. The CT scans at 3 or 6 months were used to assess sternal bone healing. A preliminary analysis of CT scans from patients with plates or wires was conducted by cardiothoracic surgeons and thoracic and musculoskeletal radiologists to develop the scanning protocol and scoring algorithm. Standard CT methods specifying parameters such as slice thickness, acquisition, spatial resolution, field of view, state of respiration, gantry tilt, algorithm, pitch, and file type were defined in the protocol and provided to each site and radiology facility. All CT scans were read by two independent radiologists in a core radiology laboratory using methodology validated for interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Axial slices were analyzed at five locations along the sternum (manubrium, top of the aortic arch, aortopulmonary window, main pulmonary arteries, and aortic root) using a 6-point quantitative scale (0 = no sign of healing, 1 = minimal healing, 2 = mild healing, 3 = moderate healing, 4 = partial synthesis, 5 = complete synthesis) (Figure 1). A mean score was assigned to each patient with a CT scan on the basis of an average of consensus scores for the sternal locations. Sternal union, a binary outcome, was defined as a mean score of 3 or greater. A score of 3 was the threshold for radiographic healing based on the observation of partial bridging bone, which indicates sternal stability and healing. This threshold was established by the radiologist and cardiothoracic surgeons. Patients independently recorded pain scores using a 10-cm visual analog scale [14]. Patients rated sternal pain at rest and with coughing, sneezing, and general movement. A total activity pain score was derived as the sum of each subscale. Pain scores were determined preoperatively and postoperatively on days 3 to 10, discharge, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Postoperative opioid analgesic usage in the hospital was evaluated by converting to equivalent morphine units to allow comparison of groups [16]. Functional outcomes were evaluated using a 21-question version of the Heart Surgery Symptom Index, a disease-specific outcome measure for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [15].\n	explicit	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL		NULL		multiple_primaries		NULL

The PSS-4 assesses the degree to which individuals evaluate their lives as stressful, especially regarding how uncontrollable and overloading relevant aspects of life are perceived. The PSS-4 comprises 4 items (Item 1: “How often have you felt you were unable to control the important things in your life?”; Item 2: “How often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?”; Item 3: “How often have you felt that things were going your way?”; Item 4: “How often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?”), yielding a score between 0 and 16. Participants rated their level of perceived stress within the last 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale (0= never; 4= very often). A two-factor structure has been commonly found for the PSS [32-35], with positively framed items representing perceived coping self-efficacy and negative items reflecting hopelessness, the latter being a strong predictor for depression [36]. Higher scores on the PSS have shown to have good predictive validity for several adverse health outcomes [36-38]. Despite its brevity, the PSS-4 has been found to have acceptable to good psychometric properties [39,40].

We hypothesized that after 6 months the intervention group would have better medication adherence, compared with the control group receiving usual care. \nMedication adherence was measured with the MARS-D, which detects nonadherent behavior (9). The MARS-D consists of five items with 5-point Likert scales (“never” to “always”) that assess how drugs are taken (possible total scores on the MARS-D range from 5 to 25). Because the final MARS-D score was left skewed in our study population, the score was dichotomized, and as in other studies, the cutoff was set at 25 (10, 11). Participants with a MARS-D score of 25 were considered to be completely adherent, and those with a lower score were considered as nonadherent in at least some way (10).\nThe primary logistic regression aimed to test the treatment effect as measured by the MARS-D score after 6 months (1, adherent; 0, nonadherent), adjusted for age, sex, and the dichotomous MARS-D score at baseline.

Outcomes were measured pre- and posttreatment, and at the 4-week follow-up.\n(Methods) Primary outcome measures: the FBC (MH: = feelings of being contaminated) was assessed during the week between treatment sessions by four daily ratings regarding intensity, vividness, and uncontrollability of the FBC and the resulting distress, similar to those used by Hackmann et al. [17] on intrusive memories. Patients were asked to rate the four parameters on visual analogue scales ranging from 0 = ‘not at all’ to 100 = ‘extremely’. Of the seven daily ratings, the mean values per week were calculated. The internal consistency of the scales was ? = 0.91. PTSD symptomatology was assessed using the German version of the well-validated Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [15] , a structured clinical interview measuring the frequency and severity of each of the 17 symptoms listed in the DSMIV diagnosis of PTSD (range 0–136; Cronbach’s ? = 0.92). Furthermore, the frequency of the DSM-IV criteria was established using the German version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) [18] , a self-report questionnaire (range 0–51; Cronbach’s ? = 0.94).	explicit	1	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL		NULL		multiple_primaries	In the MANOVA, which analyzed different components of the FBC, an interaction between condition and time was strong and highly significant, with changes in the expected direction ( F (8, 19) = 4.16, p = 0.005).

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G©) forms the generic core questionnaire of all FACIT© scales. The FACIT© scales are constructed to complement the FACT-G© scale by addressing relevant disease-, treatment-, or condition-related issues not already covered in the general questionnaire. The Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is a measure of physical aspects of QOL. It is the sum of the FACT-G subscales of physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), and any FACIT© disease-, treatment-, or conditionspecific scale. (...) The sample size was calculated for the group A starting with STF assuming an equivalence margin of 5 i.e. the MID of FACT-G, a true difference of 7 and a standard deviation of 3. A sample size of 16 achieves a power of 82% with a significance level of 0.05. Assuming the same condition for the group B we obtain 32 patients as minimum.\nThis pilot trial aimed to study the feasibility and effects on quality of life (QOL) and well-being of short-term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy in patients with gynecological cancer. All measurements were performed baseline and 8 days after each chemotherapy cycle.	ss_calculation	NULL	NULL	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL		NULL		all_significant	(Abstract) The chemotherapy-induced reduction of QOL was less than the Minimally Important Difference (MID; FACT-G = 5) with STF but greater than the MID for non-fasted periods.\n(Results) When analysing changes of QOL within the fasted or non-fasted periods by applying minimally important differences (MID for FACT-G = 5) we found for patients in group A within the first three fasted cycles a decrease of FACT-G (mean = 3.0) that was less than the MID. Thus, patients under STF did not perceive the change between FACT-G at day 0 and day 8 after chemotherapy as important. In contrast, the change of QOL for patients ofgroup A across the normocaloric diet cycles c4-c6 was greater than the MID (mean 12.8.), these patients perceived the chemotherapy-induced reduction of QOL as important [Fig. 3a,d].

Anastomotic leakage was defined according to the UK Surgical Infection Study Group (SISG) as ‘the leak of luminal contents from a surgical join between two hollow viscera. The luminal contents may emerge either through the wound or at the drain side, or they may collect near the anastomosis, causing fever, abscess, septicaemia, metabolic disturbance and/or multiple organ failure. The escape of luminal contents from the side of the anastomosis into an adjacent localized area, detected by imaging, in the absence of clinical symptoms and signs should be recorded as a subclinical leak’.14 Occurrence of anastomotic leakage was assessed until hospital discharge or readmission by the trial team. Diagnostic confirmation following suspicion of anastomotic leakage was obtained as clinically requested by endoscopy, CT scan or re-operation.

Child problem behavior during lessons was assessed using a German version of the Swanson et al. SKAMP Scale (Swanson, 1992), hereinafter referred to as SKAMP-ge (Doepfner et al., 2006). The SKAMP-ge has been well investigated regarding validity, reliability and sensitivity to change (Breuer et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2008). The scale consists of a total of ten items, with six items assessing attention and four items assessing compliance with rules in the classroom (deportment) (Doepfner et al., 2006). For our data, the internal consistencies were a¼.85 for the attention problems scale, a¼.74 for the deportment scale and a¼.85 for the overall scale. The SKAMP-ge functioned as the primary outcome measure.\n(Methods) The primary outcome was the SKAMP-ge total score, (...)\n\n(Methods) Every student underwent baseline testing (t0), which was followed by a 12-week waiting period and another assessment prior to the coaching (t1). Subsequently, teachers took part in the coaching (intervention phase, approx. 12 weeks), at the end of which a third assessment occurred (t2). This was followed by a 12-week follow-up phase, which concluded with a final measurement time point (t3).

first event of death from any cause, lifesaving cardiovascular intervention (cardiac transplantation, implantation of a ventricular assist device, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, or appropriate lifesaving shock), or unplanned hospitalization for worsening heart failure.\n(Methods) The primary study end point in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of the composite of death from any cause, a lifesaving cardiovascular intervention, or an unplanned hospitalization for worsening chronic heart failure, with the latter two end-point events being assessed by the end-point review committee. Lifesaving cardiovascular intervention included cardiac transplantation, implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, or appropriate shock for ventricular arrhythmia in patients with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.\n(...)\nSubsequent hierarchical end points to be tested if the null hypothesis for the primary end point was rejected were the first secondary end point (which was the same as the primary end point but included cardiovascular death instead of death from any cause) and the second secondary end point (which was the same as the primary end point but included unplanned hospitalization for any cause instead of unplanned hospitalization related to heart failure) (see the Supplementary Appendix). Additional secondary end points were the time to death from any cause, the time to death from cardiovascular causes, and change in NYHA class and change in the 6-minute walk distance (both as assessed at follow-up visits).\n	explicit	NULL	NULL	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	1	NULL	NULL		NULL		not_significant	(Abstract) The incidence of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the adaptive servo-ventilation group and the control group (54.1% and 50.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.31; P=0.10).	0.10

Hypothesis 1 (H 1a and H 1b): A ten-session NFT protocol of up-training alpha (8-11 Hz) and theta (5-7.5 Hz) frequency bands at Pz will significantly elevate mean absolute and relative theta and alpha amplitudes and absolute and relative theta + alpha (T+A) amplitudes within (H 1a) and across (H 1b) NFT sessions of the NFT. These measures will not change significantly in the placebo group. H 1 was only partially confirmed. Contrary to expectations, both, A/T NFT training at Pz (EG) and active placebo B u/d NFT training improved the participants’ absolute and relative alpha amplitudes, absolute and relative T+A measures, and absolute theta amplitude neared significance within sessions (while absolute alpha, theta and T+A amplitudes did not change substantially). Across sessions only absolute and relative alpha amplitudes increased (and not absolute and relative theta, absolute and relative T+A, nor the T/A ratio), i.e., there was no significant difference on average between the EG and CG when increasing the alpha- and theta-related parameters. Significant learning curves for the relative values within sessions were found for the EG as well as the CG, i.e., while there was a trend for the EG to have steeper learning curves there was no significant difference between the EG and CG in increasing the alpha and theta related parameters.\nReduction of trait anxiety and other anxiety measures (H 2). Hypothesis 2 (H 2): A ten-session NFT protocol of up-training alpha (8-11 Hz) and theta (5-7.5 Hz) frequency bands at Pz will significantly lower the subjective experience of trait anxiety. These measures will not change significantly in the placebo group.H 2 was partially confirmed. Contrary to expectations, both, A/T NFT training at Pz (EG) and active placebo B u/d NFT training (CG) led to a significant reduction in anxiety in all self-report anxiety scales anxiety (STAI-T and STAI-S, BAI, and GAD-7), including trait with large effect size. Yet a trend was observed that the A/T NFT protocol reduced anxiety measures more than the active placebo protocol of the CG.	explicit	NULL	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL		NULL		multiple_primaries	NULL	NULL
